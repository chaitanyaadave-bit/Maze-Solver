# Maze-Solver
The Maze Solver allows users to input a maze by specifying its dimensions, walls (1), and paths (0), along with start and end points. It uses Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS) to find routes, displaying both traversal paths, the shortest path found by BFS, and the total steps in that shortest route.
