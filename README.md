# Maze-Solver
The Maze Solver application shows the use of BFS and DFS algorithms to solve a maze and find a path from start to end. It shows how the two techniques use different methods to reach the end. The shortest path can be found using only BFS. The application solves a maze configuration input by the user using graph traversal algorithms; BFS and DFS and displays the results. Traversal can take place in all four direction (up, down, right, left). Different data structures like stack for DFS, queue for BFS and 2D array for maze configuration is used.
